# Circle-Junction-Re

Trying to rewrite the small demo (Circle-Junction)[https://github.com/fccm/Circle-Junction/] in ReScript.

A simple game where you can play with colored circles.

The goal is to avoid that two circles with the same color collide.

You can change the color of a circle by clicking on it.
