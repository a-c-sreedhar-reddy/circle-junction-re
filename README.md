# Circle-Junction-Re

Trying to rewrite the small demo [Circle-Junction](https://github.com/fccm/Circle-Junction/) in ReScript.

A simple game where you can play with colored circles.

The goal is to avoid that two circles with the same color collide.

You can change the color of a circle by clicking on it.

## Run locally

Run `yarn` to install packages

Run `yarn re:build` to compile rescript files to js files

Run `yarn build` to bundle all the js files

opening `circle-juntion-re.html` should work now

## Play online:
